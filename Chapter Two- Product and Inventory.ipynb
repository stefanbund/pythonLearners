    "Create an Inventory class. This class creates a list of Products, which you built last chapter. the Inventory class should fire the Product class, so that it creates many randomly named products, each with a randomly created price. The Inventory should print, using the __str__, which might also be present inside of Product, so you may see the contents. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Inventory is like the Order class above. It contains one row per item. The Inventory acts like a list of all the potential products we could stock in a store. Naturally, when we actually stock a store, our count of each product is one or more, but we can list everything we plan to sell ahead of time, with its respective price. \n",
    "\n",
    "An Inventory contains a critical list, which stores all Products. This requires a product to exist, then be appended to the list. Naturally, you can control the size of the Inventory through a single variable, which you should state as a constant. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can make gigantic inventories, with sprawling lists of products, each with a unique name and price. Go ahead and see how big an inventory you can make -- for example, Ulta states on their website that they carry roughly 200,000 products in their 1,350 stores. That is a big scale for an organization."
